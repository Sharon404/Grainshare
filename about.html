  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Grainshare began with a simple truth; that the heartbeat of our food system lies in the hands of small-scale farmers. 
    For too long, their hard work has gone unseen, their produce undervalued. 
    We built Grainshare to change that, to give small-scale farmers a fair, transparent, and reliable way to move their produce 
    and earn what their work truly deserves.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not just a founder, I am a farmer too. I've felt the uncertainty of market days, the struggle to find fair buyers, 
    and the frustration of good harvests losing value. Grainshare was born from those experiences -
    from the need to make small-scale farming more rewarding, not just for one of us, but for all farmers in our communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, we stand as a bridge between small-scale farmers and fair markets, powered by technology, guided by empathy, 
    and driven by the belief that every farmer's seed and every harvest matters.
  </p>

  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>
    To give small-scale farmers back their power to grow, through tools that simplify trading, insights that drive growth, 
    and connections that ensure fairness and sustainability at every step.
  </p>

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>
    A future where every farmer's effort is recognized, every harvest brings dignity, 
    and technology works hand in hand with people to build a stronger agricultural world.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Focus: Sorghum for Small-Scale Farmers</h3>
  <p>
    Sorghum is at the heart of our mission. This resilient crop thrives in diverse climates and requires minimal inputs, 
    making it ideal for small-scale farmers across East Africa. Sorghum not only feeds families and communities but also 
    provides nutritional security and income opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have partnered with <strong>EABL (East African Breweries Limited)</strong>, our leading sorghum buyer, to create 
    reliable markets for small-scale farmers. This partnership ensures that farmers have guaranteed buyers, fair prices, 
    and predictable income for their sorghum harvest. Together, we're building a sustainable sorghum value chain that 
    benefits farmers, buyers, and communities.
  </p>

  <h2>Message from Our CEO</h2>
  <p>
    "Whenever I meet a farmer, I see more than just crops and fields. I see courage, perseverance, and the story of every meal we share. 
    Grainshare was born from that spirit. Our promise is to make sure farmers get their fair share. 
    Technology helps us do that, but it's people who make it happen: farmers, partners, and communities, who make it all meaningful."
  </p>
