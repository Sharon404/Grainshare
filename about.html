  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Grainshare began with a simple truth - that the heartbeat of our food system lies in the hands of small farmers. 
    For too long, their hard work has gone unseen, their produce undervalued. 
    We built Grainshare to change that - to give farmers a fair, transparent, and reliable way to move their produce 
    and earn what their work truly deserves.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not just a founder - I'm a farmer too. I've felt the uncertainty of market days, the struggle to find fair buyers, 
    and the frustration of good harvests losing value. Grainshare was born from those experiences - 
    from the need to make farming more rewarding, not just for one of us, but for all of us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, we stand as a bridge between farmers and fair markets - powered by technology, guided by empathy, 
    and driven by the belief that every seed and every harvest matters.
  </p>

  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>
    To give farmers back their power - through tools that simplify trading, insights that drive growth, 
    and connections that ensure fairness and sustainability at every step.
  </p>

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>
    A future where every farmer's effort is recognized, every harvest brings dignity, 
    and technology works hand in hand with people to build a stronger agricultural world.

  <h2>Message from Our CEO</h2>
  <p>
    "Whenever I meet a farmer, I see more than just crops and fields. I see courage, perseverance, and the story of every meal we share. 
    Grainshare was born from that spirit. Our promise is simple: to make sure farmers get their fair share. 
    Technology helps us do that, but it's people who make it happen: farmers, partners, and communities, who make it all meaningful."
  </p>
